TODO:
new bug -- auth token expiration isn't getting properly caught
tests
device specific UI customization
potentially redo data model for posts as object -- {id: post}
  - this will speed up save/unsave

notes:
found bugs:
- wasn't updating top with unsave (missing call)
- wasn't destroying the callbacks properly
